classdef dataframe < handle
    %dataframe holds frame specific data together with pointers to
    %additional information. This class has all the information that is
    %needed to be passed to the different steps of the analysis algoritm.
    %
    %The dataframe class is a handle subclass to avoid unneeded memory
    %duplication as it is passed to functions. Input variables are set at
    %creation and cannot be overwritten. These are: the sample and io
    %classes, frameNr, frameHasEdge, rawImage and priorLocations. Algorithm
    %output variables that can be set are : preProcessedImage, LabelImage,
    %measurements and classificationResults. Sample specific information
    %such as the names of the different channels are available in the
    %linked sample class. Use the linked io class for actions such as the
    %loading of an adjacent frame or the saving of a labeled image.
    
    %Raw image dimensions:[x-axis,y-axis,fluophore]
    %the channel order should be discussed as a starting point the
    %following convention is used:
    %The first channel = exclusion marker
    %second channel = DNA marker
    %third channel = inclusion marker
    %additional channels = extra markers
